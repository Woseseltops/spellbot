There are more important things in life, but $o should be $c here. Just in case other redditors were confused.
Reddit, let's not complain about $o and $c for now.
Hi $u, you probably meant $c instead of $o.
Hi $u, in case you didn't know: $o should be $c.
Hi $u, never mind, but $o should have been $c.
Hi $u, if you're interested in correct spelling: $o -> $c.
Inspiring stuff, $u, even with $o instead of $c.
All right, I'll say it to save other redditors the time: $o should have been $c.
This message would be even better with $c instead of $o.
$c, $o, what does it matter... (but I prefer $c here :) ).
Wow, if only $o would have been $c this would have been perfect.
This is so cool, it doesn't even matter that $o should have been $c.
Very interesting, $u. I would have said $c instead of $o, but still interesting.
Hey $u, $c or $o? (hint: $c)
Psst, $u! That should have been $c instead of $o.
There are more important things than caring about $o and $c. $u knows that.
*cough* $o should be $c *cough*
This message couldn't have been any better. Except maybe for that $o -> $c thing.
