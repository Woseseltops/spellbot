Hi $u, you probably meant $c instead of $o.
Hi $u, in case you didn't know: $o should be $c.
Hi $u, never mind, but $o should have been $c.
Hi $u, if you're interested in correct spelling: $o -> $c.
Inspiring message, $u, even with $o instead of $c.
Lovely tweet, $u, but I would have said $c instead of $o.
$u I wish I could come up with things like that. The only thing I can think of is $o -> $c.
$u I think you should have typed $c instead of $o... but who am I?
Hi $u, this message would be even better with $c instead of $o.
$u $c, $o, what does it matter... (but I prefer $c here :) ).
Wow, $u, if only $o would have been $c this would have been perfect.
$u, this tweet is so cool, it doesn't even matter that $o should have been $c.
You know what, $u? For now, I'm not going to complain about $o -> $c.
Right, $u! Who cares about $o -> $c? I don't, that's for sure!
$u, yeah... that thing about confusing $o with $c is stupid anyway.
Very interesting, $u. I would have said $c instead of $o, but still interesting.
$u if I'd known you better, I'd tell that you this should be $c instead of $o.
$u I really don't care about $o or $c (but in case you do: I'd use $c here).
I think $u is right... $o instead of $c isn't a big deal.
$u I'm not saying anything (but $o should be $c).
Hey $u, $c or $o? (hint: $c)
Psst, $u! That should have been $c instead of $o.
$u, not that anybody cares, but $o should have been $c.
$u Yeah, I think people complaining about $c instead of $o are stupid too.
Even though $o should be $c, I think $u's message is still cool.
There are more important things than caring about $o and $c. $u knows that.
Well said, $u, well said. Even with $o instead of $c.
$u I couldn't have said it better (although I would have said $c instead of $o).
$u *cough* $o should be $c *cough*
$u This tweet is so good, it almost makes me forget about $o and $c.
$u This message couldn't have been any better. Except maybe for that $o -> $c thing.
You're right, $u. Caring about $o and $c is wasting time.
