Hi $u, you probably meant $c instead of $o.
Hi $u, in case you didn't know: $o should be $c.
Hi $u, not important, but $o should have been $c.
Hi $u, if you're interested in correct spelling: $o -> $c.
Inspiring message, $u, even with $o instead of $c.
Lovely tweet, $u, but I would have said $c instead of $o.
$u I wish I could come up with things like that. The only thing I can think of is $o -> $c.
$u I think you should have typed $c instead of $o... but who am I?
Hi $u, this message would be even better with $c instead of $o.
$u $c, $o, what does it matter... (but I prefer $c here :) ).
